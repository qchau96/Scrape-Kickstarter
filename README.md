# Scrape-Kickstarter

I LOVE board games and once in a while, I would go on Kickstarter and check out the new board game projects that they have. It made me curious, and wanted to do an Analysis on Game Projects on Kickstarter.

There are a lot of Kickstarter Datasets online, including this website. However, for the purpose of learning, I decided to stick with BeautifulSoup, a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. Please use [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qchau96/Scrape-Kickstarter/blob/master/Kickstarter_Analysis.ipynb) to see a full version of this project
